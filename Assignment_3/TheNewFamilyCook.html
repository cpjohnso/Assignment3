            <h4>
                <U>What is a baking stone?</U>  A baking stone is a thick ceramic plate. Baking stones better distribute heat to bread as it bakes.
                This allows for an even bake and an improved crust.

            <h4>
                <U>How is this different from a bread baker?</U>  A bread baker is an enclosed baking stone.
                Because the bread is in an enclosed, evenly heated space the bread is given a better bake.
                Also, it's an oven inside an oven.

            <h4>
                <U>What is a proofing bowl?</U>  A proofing bowl is a bowl that you put your bread dough into.
                Over time the dough will expand, because of science. The bowl holds the dough while it proofs.
                That's it.

            </figure>
            <h4>
                <U>Is there anything special about a proofing bowl?</U>  One. You can be reasonably assured that the last thing in the proofing bowl was bread dough.
                I mean look at that thing. It looks like it came out of a museum. When your kid comes upon that bowl, they wont try to eat cereal out of it.
                Because that bowl is fancy. That's got to be worth something.

            <h4>
                <U>What is a flour sifter?</U>  When stored, flour tends to form into clumps.
                A flour sifter catches these clumps before they end up in the dough.
                The caught clumps are then broken up so they can pass through the sifter.

            Why is bread important? Civilization and sandwiches, both are built on top of bread. Bread is actually an indicator of social complexity. In order to make bread certain grains are required. The cultivation of land required a committment to the land. Nomadic lifestyles were slowly transitioned into settled, agrarian communities. Hierarchies were formed for the defense and management of these villages. These hierarchies eventually became governments. Governments provided further stability so that societies could grow. Bread is one of the primary markers that a people are growing into a civilization.
