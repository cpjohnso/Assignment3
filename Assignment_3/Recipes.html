            Ingredients
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces bittersweet chocolate chips 60-70% cacao</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder not Dutch-processed</li>
            <li>1 cup pecans chopped, optional</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mini semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt bittersweet chocolate chips and butter in a heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly until melted and well-combined.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the eggs, sugars, vanilla, baking powder, and salt on high speed 5 minutes, or until the batter is thick and creamy. This step is key, so make sure to beat the mixture for the full 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce the speed to low, and mix in the melted chocolate until well-combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour and cocoa powder just until combined.</li>
            <li>Add nuts, if using, and mini chocolate chips. Stir in to combine. The batter should be the consistency of a thick brownie batter at this point.</li>
            <li>Cover the batter, and chill for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Using a 1.5 tablespoon cookie scoop, drop batter onto the prepared cookie sheets about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake cookies 8-10 minutes. The cookie will look set at the edges but still be a little wet looking in the center. Don't overbake, or the cookies won't be crackly and fudgy.</li>
            <li>The shiny, crackly crust will develop as the cookies cool on the baking sheet.</li>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 box red velvet cake mix</li>
            <li>1 can cream cheese frosting (16 oz.)</li>
            <li>1½ packages candy melts (any color you want!)</li>
            <li>Cisco Shortening</li>
            <li>Wax paper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bake cake per instructions on box for 13X9 cake</li>
            <li>After cake is cooked and cooled completely, crumble into large bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix thoroughly with 1 can cream cheese frosting. (It may be easier to use fingers to mix together but be warned it will get messy.)</li>
            <li>Roll mixture into quarter size balls and lay on cookie sheet. (Should make 45-50. You can get even more if you use a mini ice cream scooper, but I like to hand roll them.)</li>
            <li>Chill for several hours. (You can speed this up by putting in the freezer.)</li>
            <li>Melt candy melts in microwave per directions on package.</li>
            <li>Roll balls in chocolate and lay on wax paper until firm. (Use a spoon to dip and roll in chocolate and then tap off extra.)</li>

        </center>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pouch Pamela’s Products Chocolate Brownie Mix</li>
            <li>1/2 cup canola or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/3 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Nutella or chocolate-hazelnut spread (chocolate-peanut butter may be substituted)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>Hot fudge, for drizzling (homemade or store bought)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F. Line an 8-inch square pan with aluminum foil leaving overhang and spray with cooking spray, or grease and flour the pan; set aside.</li>
            <li>To a large bowl, add the brownie mix, oil, water, and stir to combine; don’t overmix.</li>
            <li>Turn all but 1/2 cup batter out into the pan, smoothing the batter with a spatula as needed; reserve remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Evenly drizzle the Nutella over brownie batter in pan, lightly smoothing with a spatula as needed. Tip – Make drizzling and spreading the Nutella easier by microwaving it for 5 to 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Evenly sprinkle the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Evenly dollop the remaining 1/2 cup brownie batter over the chocolate chips, lightly smoothing with a spatula as needed. Note that remaining batter won’t completely cover the surface and there will be ‘bare patches’ with exposed Nutella and chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 25 minutes, or until edges have set and center is no longer overly glossy or wet-looking. The toothpick test is very unreliable because you’ll likely hit chocolate chips, chocolate chunks, or Nutella, making the toothpick look wet even though brownies are done. I err on the side of under-done than over-done and 25 minutes in my oven allowed for very fudgy, gooey brownies. If you prefer more well-done brownies, bake a bit longer. The brownies firm up quite a bit as they cool.</li>
            <li>Allow brownies to cool in pan for at least 30 minutes before drizzling with hot fudge, slicing, and serving. Brownies will keep airtight at room temp for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months.</li>
