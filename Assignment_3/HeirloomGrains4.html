<p > <U>History:</U>  The history of Turkey Red wheat in the United States
is closely associated with the movement of Russian Mennonite immigrants to the
middle Great Plains. These people originally went from west Prussia to southern
Russia about 1770 because of certain land grants and civil privileges offered
by the Government under Empress Catherine. One hundred years later their
descendants, desiring further advantages to be obtained in America, emigrated
to the middle Great Plains and settled principally in Kansas. Each family
brought over a bushel or more of Crimean wheat for seed, and from this seed was
grown the first crop of Kansas Turkey Red hard winter wheat. </p>

<p> <U>Flavor:</U> complex, nutty</p>

<p align = center ><img src="img/image003.jpg" HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=200 ></p>

<p > <U>History:</U> Around 1842, David Fife, of Ontario, Canada, received a
small sample of wheat from a friend in Glasgow, Scotland. The friend had
obtained the sample from a shipload of wheat from the port of Danzig in
Germany, but supposedly of Russian origin. Mr. Fife sowed the wheat in the
spring. From it descended the wheat that became known as &quot;Red Fife&quot;
throughout Canada.</p>

<p align = center ><img src="img/image005.jpg"    HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=200 ></p>

<p><U>History:</U>  Marquis is a cross between Red Fife wheat and Red
Calcutta wheat(imported from India in the late 1800s), developed in Canada in 1906.
Attention was first attracted to Marquis wheat in the United States through its
having won prizes at several expositions. Seed was introduced by the United
States Department of Agriculture in 1912 and 1913. A considerable quantity was
brought into the country for sowing in 1913. In 1919, only 7 years after its
introduction, it made up at least 60 percent, or nearly 12,000,000 acres, of
the total spring-wheat acreage of the United States. </p>

<p>  <U>Flavor:</U> rich and subtle</p>
